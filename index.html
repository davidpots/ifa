      <p class="review-text">Rude employee! I work at another Orange Leaf in Austin, and the staff where I work at are not rude like this black lady that was working there last night! From the moment I stepped foot, she was being rude and snarky! Their manager needs to give them a lesson or two about customer service, because I know for sure my manager would be very upset if I was being rude to a customer!!!</p>
